//! Pure span/trace export helpers: the span data model, NDJSON serialization,
//! OTLP/HTTP JSON conversion in Langfuse conventions, Langfuse ingestion-batch
//! chunking and the pure parts of journal export.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O. Hosts own credentials, URL resolution, transport
//! and the progress-event collector that produces the spans; they pass an
//! [`ExportBrand`] so product identity strings stay out of this crate.
