//! The mirror owns the snapshot, the flush policy (iteration / tool boundaries,
//! never per streaming delta), the size caps on persisted tool I/O and prose,
//! the interrupted-turn finalization, and the transcript / tool-timeline
//! bookkeeping helpers. A host translates its own progress events into calls on
//! these: mutate [`TurnStateMirror::state`], call the `push_*` helpers, then
//! [`TurnStateMirror::flush`] at boundaries.
//!
//! On a completed turn the host sets [`TurnStateMirror::turn_completed`] so
//! [`TurnStateMirror::finish`] leaves the snapshot alone; if the bridge exits
//! without ever seeing completion (for example because the agent loop errored),
//! `finish` flags the snapshot [`crate::turn_state::types::TurnLifecycle::Interrupted`] and carries the
//! partial streamed answer into the session transcript.
